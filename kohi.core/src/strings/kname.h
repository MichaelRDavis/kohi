 * @brief This files contains an implementation of knames.
 *
 * @details
 * KNames are a lightweight system to manage strings within an application for
 * quick comparisons. Each KName is hashed into a unique number stored as a key
 * in a lookup table for later use. This lookup table also stores a copy of the
 * original string. KNames are immutable, and thus cannot be changed once internalized
 * into the lookup table, even when reused.
 *
 * KNames are case-insensitive .
 * NOTE: case-insensitivity applies to regular ascii and western european high-ascii characters only.
 *
 * @version 1.0
